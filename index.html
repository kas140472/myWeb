    <div class="about-me">Hey there! I'm Kriti, a software developer on a mission to use technology for meaningful change, particularly benefitting women and the queer community.<br><br>

My journey began as a Mechanical Engineer, but my passion for software development soon took over, and I made the exciting transition. I find both the complexities of thermodynamics of combustion and software development equally fascinating.<br><br>

Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, where I'm constantly growing and expanding my skills. I have a diverse internship background encompassing academia, industry, and startup environments, with demonstrated excellence in analytical problem-solving, backed by hands-on project experience spanning web development, machine learning, computer networks, and operating systems. I aim to leverage my education, analytical prowess, and technical programming skills to excel in the role of a Software Engineer.<br><br>

I am actively seeking opportunities for Spring 2024 co-op, Summer 2024 internships, or a full-time position starting in July 2024. My graduation dates are flexible, allowing me to apply for both internship roles, with graduation in December 2024, or full-time positions, with graduation in July 2024.<br><br>      
        
I believe in having a growth mindset and practicing gratitude.<br><br>

Beyond my studies and work, I have a whole array of hobbies that keep me engaged and happy. Reading is my thingâ€”I devour everything from fiction and non-fiction to fanfiction and news articles. I also have a penchant for writing and have contributed as a Content Writer for various organizations (including a large-scale hackathon). In the past, I have practiced Martial Arts, and I still tinker with playing the piano!<br><br>

I have two amazing pet cats (Lulu and Piku).<br><br>

Being actively involved and giving back to the community is important to me. I volunteer at university events and support organizations like WaterDrop LA.<br><br>

I'm excited about my journey and eager to see where it takes me! <br>
