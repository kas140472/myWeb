    <h1>Hello.</h1>
    
    <div class="about-me">Hey there! I'm Kriti, a software developer on a mission to use technology for meaningful change, especially for women and queer individuals. <br><br>
        My journey began as a Mechanical Engineer, but my passion for software development soon took over, and I made the exciting transition. 
        I find both the complexities of thermodynamics of combustion and software development equally fascinating.<br><br>

        Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, where I'm constantly growing and expanding my skills. I believe in having a growth mindset and being grateful for what I have and the opportunities that life brings.<br><br>
        
        Beyond my studies and work, I have a whole array of hobbies that keep me engaged and happy. Reading is my thingâ€”I devour everything from fiction and non-fiction to fanfiction and news articles. In the past, I dabbled in Martial Arts, and I still tinker with playing the piano, even if my skills are a bit rusty!<br><br>
        
        Giving back to the community is essential to me. I volunteer at university events and support organizations like WaterDrop LA.<br><br>
        
        I'm excited about my journey and eager to see where it takes me! <br>
